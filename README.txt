I created a console based simulation for a Retirement InvestMent Calculator.
This is a project for my Object Oriented Programming class.

How to Run:
Run the src\retirement_investment_calculator\Main.java file

Testing Process:
I first tested all of the example cases listed in the project guidlines. 
Afterwards, I tested my application against a similar compound interest calculator that I found online to see if I got the same results.
I also made sure to test every available branch in my code to make sure that ALL of it was working. (Tested every type of error that could occur with incorrect input.)

Logical Errors:
The program will be stuck in an infinite prompting loop is the user inputs 100 as their current age
